# Action Plan Rule

Every substantial piece of work — provisioning a set of resources, standing up a pipeline stage, scaffolding a microservice, a migration, a teardown — gets a PRD (Plan of Record Document) under `docs/action_plan/` **before execution starts**. The PRD is written first, reviewed/approved by the user, then executed against. No PRD, no execution.

## Purpose

PRDs exist so that cost- and security-relevant work on the AWS environment is deliberate: what will change, what it costs, how we know it worked, and how we undo it — decided *before* anything runs. They also record which agents do what, so orchestration is reviewable.

## Location & naming

PRDs are **organized per microservice**, so each service's plan-of-record history is self-contained. Cross-cutting infrastructure (shared VPC/ECS cluster/ECR, the CI/CD pipeline, teardown) lives in a `platform/` folder.

```
docs/action_plan/
├── README.md                    # index across all PRDs, with status
├── _template.md                 # starting point for every PRD
├── platform/                    # cross-cutting infra & pipeline PRDs
│   └── NNNN-short-title.md
└── <service-name>/              # one folder per microservice, created when the service is first scoped
    └── NNNN-short-title.md
```

- **Service folders are dynamic** — we don't yet know which microservices exist. Create a `docs/action_plan/<service-name>/` folder (kebab-case, matching the service's folder under `services/`) the first time that service gets a PRD. Do not pre-create empty folders.
- **Filename:** `NNNN-short-title.md` — zero-padded sequence, kebab-case title (e.g. `0001-service-scaffold.md`). Numbering is **per folder** (each service and `platform/` has its own sequence starting at `0001`). Never renumber. Start from `docs/action_plan/_template.md`.
- `docs/action_plan/README.md` is the index: one line per PRD, grouped by service/platform, with its status.

## Fleshing out a PRD

Before a PRD is written up for approval, run the `/grill-me` command ([`.claude/commands/grill-me.md`](../commands/grill-me.md)) to interview the user through the open design decisions. The PRD is drafted from the answers — do not fill the required sections below from assumptions when a decision is genuinely the user's to make.

## Required sections (every PRD)

1. **Status & metadata** — `Draft → Approved → In Progress → Done` (or `Abandoned`), date, author. Execution may only start once the user has marked/confirmed **Approved**. Update the status as work proceeds.
2. **User story** — who needs this and why, in `As a … I want … so that …` form. Keeps the work tied to a project goal, not an implementation itch.
3. **Scope** — explicitly **in scope** and **out of scope**. Out-of-scope is mandatory: it is where scope creep is caught.
4. **Success criteria** — measurable, checkable statements ("`terraform validate` passes", "service `/health` returns 200 on the cluster", "plan shows 0 destroys"). Each one must be verifiable by a command or observation, not vibes.
5. **Resources** — what is touched or created: AWS resources (with Terraform resource types), files/modules in the repo, external references (docs, provider registry pages). State the expected **cost impact** of any new resource (AWS Free Tier vs. billable).
6. **Scripts / commands** — the concrete commands that will be run (or added to workflows), in order. Destructive or billable commands (`terraform apply`, `aws … create/delete`, `aws ecs update-service`) must be explicitly listed here — nothing billable runs that the PRD didn't name.
7. **Planned agents** — which agents (`app-engineer`, `terraform-engineer`, `pipeline-engineer`, `infra-reviewer`, `documentation-keeper`) are used, for which step, and what each hands off. If a step is done in the main session instead of an agent, say so.
8. **Testing / verification plan** — how we prove it works after execution: commands, expected outputs, smoke checks, and the infra-reviewer pass. Every success criterion from §4 must map to at least one verification step here.
9. **Additional considerations** — anything material that doesn't fit above: security posture impact, rollback/teardown path (how this work dies under `terraform destroy`), open questions, cross-team dependencies, timing constraints.

## Conventions

- PRDs are **plans, not documentation of record**: once executed, outcomes belong in the proper taxonomy (ADRs under `docs/architecture/decisions/` for decisions, `docs/operations/` for pipeline/release/runbook docs). The PRD gets a short **Outcome** note at the bottom (what actually happened, deviations from plan) and its status set to `Done` — it is not rewritten into a report.
- Deviations during execution that change scope, cost, or security posture require going back to the PRD: amend it and re-confirm with the user before continuing. Small mechanical deviations are just noted in the Outcome.
- No secrets, credentials, real AWS account IDs, ARNs, or resource identifiers in PRDs — same rule as all docs.
- Cross-link the PRD to the ADRs/runbooks/docs it produces, and vice versa.
- The `documentation-keeper` agent respects this folder as part of the docs taxonomy; the main session (orchestrator) owns writing PRDs, since it assigns the agents.
